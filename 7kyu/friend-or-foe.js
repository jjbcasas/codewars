// Description:
// Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

// If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

// Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"]
// Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

// Input = ["Peter", "Stephen", "Joe"]
// Output = []
// Input strings will only contain letters.
// Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.

//  My Solution

function friend(friends){
    // make a loop tyat filters for a 4 letters string
    return friends.filter( elem => elem.length === 4)
  }
